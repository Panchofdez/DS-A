1. Make it work first. Find a recursive solution (brute force solution)
 - visualize problem as a tree
 - each node is a subproblem 
 - implement tree using recursion 
 - test it 

2.then solve for efficiency
 - store solutions to subproblems in a table/memo using memoization where the keys are the arguments
 - add a base case to return stored values
 - store return values into our table/memo before returning
